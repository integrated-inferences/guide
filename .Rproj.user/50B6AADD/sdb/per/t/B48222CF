He has helped me out on a nuber of occasions when I reached out to him on some methodological issue or other and he was always quick and helpful often pointing me to literatures I was not aware of or helping me see the problem from a new angle. I also engaged with him quite a bit over a piece that he wrote @imai2010causal before publication; the interactions were friendly enough and ended in a better place than they might have; more on that below.\n\nThe strengths of Imai's file are quite clear. There are two points of concern that I know would be subjects of discussion at Columbia; one relates to the extent that Imai's work is based on innovation or arbitrage; the second is around research ethics. I touch on both of those below, though I am somewhat imited in my ability to contribute on hte second of these points as I  am not a methodologist.\n\nImai has published a lot and his work is well cited. He currently has about 10,000 cites on google scholar and a h index of 36. This is not nowhere close to Gary King or Andy Gelman territory but it is well beyond most others in your comparson list. \n\n\n**Comparisons.** You asked for some comparisons with King, Sehon, Katz, Box-Steffensmeier and Quinn.  After Gary King (an inappropriate comparison) I rank Imai at the top of your comparison list (excluding Box-Steffensmeier from th comparison; I do not know her  work so well having doen little on event history modellling area.). Imai is most similar in style to King though is much earlier in his career. He shares with King a real diversity of interests, a good eye for identifying issues of importance to political science that have been worked on in other fields, an ability to translate difficult concepts (King is perhaps stronger on this front) and a commitment to producing practical tools that are of broad use; Imai's tools are typically packages, whereas King aims higher producing packages but also infrastructures, such as dataverse and related. King also engages more roadly in debates in teh discipline, such as around replication. Imai shares with King an ability to identify and train srong students. They share a tendency to promote their methods by exagerrating the flaws in the work of others.  Quinn ad Katz have both had a great influence on the field though their contributions rest on a narrower base, Katz's major contributions focussing on the analysis of panel data and Quinn's on promiting  MCMC mehtods.  Sekhon also works on a narrower base focused primarily on matching; thoug he has made broader contributions his impact has been less great, perhaps as he is more oriented towards biomedical sciences. Katz's major contributions were in the 1990s and there have been few big impact pieces in the last ten years.   Of this group Imai is most clearly on an a strong upward trajectory.\n\n\nSome sort of statemetns are a bit hard to evaluation \"For data sets where preprocessing reduces the extent of the relationship between $Ti$ and $Xi$, but is unable to make them completely unrelated, model dependence is not eliminated but will normally be greatly reduced.\"\"\n\nThe work on matching @ho2007matching and @ho2006matchit (also @imai2008misunderstandings) counts for about a third of Imai's citations. This work has has a very strong impact on the field and played a big part in poularizing the method. I discuss the originality of the contribution below, as best as I can make it out. In general though the piece makes a clear and compelling case for matching and also is a relatively early piece in the political science literature to popularize the potential outcomes framework. The accompanying package made these procedures implementable for many In subsequent years many hav ebeen concerned that there  has been considerable overclaiming for the benefits of matching and some this  it may be traceable to this paper. For example the  paper claims that one-to-one exact matching \"directly parallels an experiment where we find pairs of units that are identical in all observable ways and assign one from each pair to be treated and the other to be a control.\" This is misleading on at least two counts; experiments do not achieve balance on observables in practice, but most important they do achieve balance on non observables in expectation, which matching does not. The piece also claims that mching   can eliminate  \"any bias from incorrect assumptions made during the parametric stage of analysis,\" which is also clearly incorrect---likely what is meant is about biases stemming specifically from the parametric assumptions on the observable, but written a it is it sounds like a general license for infernece. More on this paper below.\n\nThe second set of influential contributions is in the area of causal mediation. \n\nA related piece focuses on  gneralization of the propensity score. Most treatments using propensity scores or propensity matching focus on binary treatment and the propensity is the probability of being in one of two conditions.   @ImaiDyk (published in JASA) consider continuous treatment regimes (\"propensity function as the conditional prob-\nability of the actual, perhaps multivariate, treatment given the\nobserved covariate\"). The idea here is for a general treatment, say $t$ is  distributed over some range of possible values according to the distribution $e(t|X)$ and say $t^p$ is the potental outcome then $p(Y(t^{poential})|t^{actual}, e(|X) = p(Y(t^{potential}) | e(|X))$; so if you condition on the assignment probability then you can ignore teh actual assignment when assessing the potential outcome. The proof is fairly immediate and most of the paper is putting the approach to use in practice. It is hard to assess the originality on the theoretical side; it seems to me that the key idea as the generalized propensity score (see @imbens1999role   and @joffe1999invited wher eit appears as a kind of afterthought (p 331); or @hirano2004propensity  for cntinuous treatments), though  @ImaiDyk righty point out that hte generali idea works for broader treatments (eg multivalues treatments).\n\n\" Matching has \n**Concerns** I expect that if this case were discussed at Columbia the discusison would center on two concerns. \n\nThe first is whether Imai's research is really innovative or is it largely arbitrage. I think it is obvious that to a large extent the impact of Imai's work result from successful arbitrage or important innovations from other fields, notably statistics. Unfortunately I find it a little hard to assess what parts are truly novel in the work. The most influential paper, on matching, has been important for raising the profile of matching techniques in political science. Imai and coauthors cite the rather large literature already existing at the time (they cite Cochran adn Rubin, Rubin, Rosenbaum and others ad they note that their \"recommendations already constitute current best practice.\" Thre is some attempt to sell the piece as an innovation (\"the present paper is the first to propose and work out the conditions for matching as a general method of nonparametric preprocessing, suitable for improving any parametric method.\") though it is a little half hearted. Most of the paper lays out the matching approach, clarifies some misconceptions, and gives some examples. It is framed as a piece that shows when matching facilitates parametric methods, but it really is almost entirely about the principle of matching and the associated software, MatchIt facilitates different forms of preexisting matching techniques and is not a tool specifically related to analysis strategies.  I spent a bit of time trying to figure out the generalization claimed in this study but could not find it. The key results of importance seem to be in  Rubin and Thomas 1992 (\"Matching in this setting thus reduces bias in any function of the X's, including the outcome of interest (Rubin and Thomas 1992)\") and I could not see the generalization beyond the setting described in Rubin and Thomas.  \nAs discussed above the  theoretical contribution in @ImaiDyk also seems modest given existing work on teh generalized propensity score  \n",
