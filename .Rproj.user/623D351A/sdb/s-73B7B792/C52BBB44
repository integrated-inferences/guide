As long as the electoral arena does not change and the current electoral regime benefits the ruling parties, the electoral system is not altered. As the electoral arena changes (due to the entry of new voters or a change in voters' preferences), the ruling parties modify the electoral system, depending on the emergence of new parties and the coordinating capacities of the old parties. When the new parties are strong, the old parties shift from plurality/majority to proportional representation if no old party enjoys a dominant position, but they do not do this if there is a dominant old party. When new entrants are weak, a system of nonproportional representation is maintained, regardless of the structure of the old party system.},\n     language = {English},\n     year = {1999},\n     publisher = {American Political Science Association},\n     copyright = {Copyright © 1999 American Political Science Association},\n    }\n\n@book{gelman2013bayesian,\n  title={Bayesian Data Analysis},\n  author={Gelman, Andrew and Carlin, John B and Stern, Hal S and Dunson, David B and Vehtari, Aki and Rubin, Donald B},\n  year={2013},\n  publisher={Boca Raton, FL: CRC Press}\n}\n\n@article{miguel2004economic,\n  title={Economic shocks and civil conflict: An instrumental variables approach},\n  author={Miguel, Edward and Satyanath, Shanker and Sergenti, Ernest},\n  journal={Journal of political Economy},\n  volume={112},\n  number={4},\n  pages={725--753},\n  year={2004},\n  publisher={JSTOR}\n}\n\n\n@article{ericson1969subjective,\n  title={Subjective Bayesian models in sampling finite populations},\n  author={Ericson, William A},\n  journal={Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

political scientists have few systematic guides for carrying out such work. this paper details a unified approach which joins intensive case-study analysis with statistical analysis. not only are the advantages of each approach combined, but also there is a synergistic value to the nested research design: for example, statistical analyses can guide case selection for in-depth research, provide direction for more focused case studies and comparisons, and be used to provide additional tests of hypotheses generated from small-n research. small-n analyses can be used to assess the plausibility of observed statistical relationships between variables, to generate theoretical insights from outlier and other cases, and to develop better measurement strategies. this integrated strategy improves the prospects of making valid causal inferences in cross-national and other forms of comparative research by drawing on the distinct strengths of two important approaches.

Although field experimentation is often considered a quantitative enterprise, this paper illustrates the compatibility of field experimentation with various types of qualitative measurement tools and research questions. Integrating qualitative and quantitative data within field experiments allows investigators to move past simple average treatment effects and explore mechanisms of the identified causal effect. A more novel proposal is to use field experimentation as the organizing methodological framework for archival, ethnographic, or interpretive work, and to use ethnographic methods as the primary source of measurement in “experimental ethnography.” Sustained research and theoretical specificity can address some of the seemingly incompatible features of qualitative and field experimental methods. For example, small sample sizes are acceptable as part of a research program, and some theories of historical patterns or rare events could be disaggregated into smaller cause-and-effect linkages to test with field experiments in theoretically relevant contexts.},\nURL = {http://ann.sagepub.com/content/628/1/59.abstract},\neprint = {http://ann.sagepub.com/content/628/1/59.full.pdf+html},\njournal = {The ANNALS of the American Academy of Political and Social Science}\n}\n\n@incollection{Hall2003aligning,\n\ttitle = {Aligning Ontology and Methodology in Comparative Research},\n\tbooktitle = {Comparative Historical Analysis in the Social Sciences},\n\tyear = {2003},\n\tpages = {373-404},\n\tpublisher = {Cambridge University Press},\n\torganization = {Cambridge University Press},\n\taddress = {Cambridge, UK and New York},\n\tauthor = {Peter A.

First, we can ameliorate the effects of difficult-to-measure outcomes by including qualitative information on outcomes within matched sets, sometimes reducing p-values. Second, additional information across matched sets enables the construction of qualitative confidence intervals on effect size. Third, qualitative information on unmeasured confounders within matched sets reduces the conservativeness of Rosenbaum-style sensitivity analysis. This approach accommodates small to medium sample sizes in a nonparametric framework, and therefore may be particularly useful for analyses of the effects of institutions in a given set of countries or subnational units. We illustrate these methods by examining the effect of using plurality rules in transitional presidential elections on opposition harassment in 1990s sub-Saharan Africa.},\n\tauthor = {Glynn, A.N. and Ichino, N.},\n\tjournal = {American Journal of Political Science}\n}\n\n@article{Rohlfing2013comphyp,\n    author = {Rohlfing, Ingo},\n    title = {Comparative Hypothesis Testing Via Process Tracing},\n    year = {2013},\n    doi = {10.1177/0049124113503142},\n    abstract ={Causal inference via process tracing has received increasing attention during recent years.

Second, in focusing on the dimension of uniqueness of the 2 × 2 typology, I show that it is important to distinguish between theoretical and empirical uniqueness when choosing cases and generating inferences via process tracing. Third, I demonstrate that the standard reading of the so-called doubly decisive test is misleading. It conflates unique implications of a hypothesis with contradictory implications between one hypothesis and another. In order to remedy the current ambiguity of the dimension of uniqueness, I propose an expanded typology of hypothesis tests that is constituted by three dimensions.},\n    URL = {http://smr.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/10/11/0049124113503142.abstract},\n    eprint = {http://smr.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/10/11/0049124113503142.full.pdf+html},\n    journal = {Sociological Methods \\& Research},\n    volume = {43},\n    number = {4},\n    page = {606--642}  }\n\n@book{rohlfing2012case,\n  title={Case Studies and Causal Inference: An Integrative Framework},\n  author={Rohlfing, I.},\n  isbn={9781137271310},\n  series={Research Methods Series},\n  url={http://books.google.ca/books?id=4W\\_XuA3njRQC},\n  year={2012},\n  publisher={New York: Palgrave Macmillan}\n}\n\n\n\n@phdthesis{Lengfelder2012diss,\n\tauthor={Lengfelder, Christina},\n\ttitle={Triangular Development Cooperation: How emerging powers change the landscape of development cooperation},\n\tschool={Universidad Católica de Chile},\n\tyear={2012},\n\ttype={PhD dissertation},\n\t}\n\n\n\t@article{Fairfield201342,\ntitle = \"Going Where the Money Is: Strategies for Taxing Economic Elites in Unequal Democracies \",\njournal = \"World Development \",\nvolume = \"47\",\nnumber = \"0\",\npages = \"42 - 57\",\nyear = \"2013\",\nnote = \"\",\nissn = \"0305-750X\",\ndoi = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.02.011\",\nurl = \"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000648\",\nauthor = \"Tasha Fairfield\",\nkeywords = \"comparative politics\",\nkeywords = \"Latin America\",\nkeywords = \"economic elites\",\nkeywords = \"inequality\",\nkeywords = \"tax reform\",\nkeywords = \"politics of policymaking \",\nabstract = \"Summary How can policymakers circumvent obstacles to taxing economic elites?

The basic idea is that, in many applications, researchers may be able to make more plausible causal assumptions conditional on the value of a posttreatment variable than they would be able to do unconditionally. As data become available on a posttreatment variable, these conditional causal assumptions become active and information about the effect of interest is gained.

Similarities and differences between process tracing and the deductive-nomological model of explanation are explored.},\nkeywords = {causal inference; case studies; hypothesis testing; deductive-nomological model},\nurl = {http://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:sae:somere:v:41:y:2012:i:4:p:570-597}\n}\n\n@book{bennett2014process,\n  title={Process tracing},\n  author={Bennett, Andrew and Checkel, Jeffrey T},\n  year={2014},\n  publisher={Cambridge University Press}\n}\n\n@article{gordon2004quantitative,\n  title={Quantitative leverage through qualitative knowledge: Augmenting the statistical analysis of complex causes},\n  author={Gordon, Sanford C and Smith, Alastair},\n  journal={Political Analysis},\n  volume={12},\n  number={3},\n  pages={233--255},\n  year={2004},\n  publisher={SPM-PMSAPSA}\n}\n\n@article{poirier1980partial,\n  title={Partial observability in bivariate probit models},\n  author={Poirier, Dale J},\n  journal={Journal of Econometrics},\n  volume={12},\n  number={2},\n  pages={209--217},\n  year={1980},\n  publisher={Elsevier}\n}\n\n\n@incollection{Bennett:Bayes,\n    address = {Oxford, UK},\n    author = {Bennett, Andrew},\n    booktitle = {The Oxford Handbook of Political Methodology},\n    citeulike-article-id = {8062952},\n    comment = {1110b},\n    editor = {Box-Steffensmeier, Janet M. and Brady, Henry E. and Collier, David},\n    keywords = {bayes, case\\_study, degrees\\_of\\_freedom, methodology, overdetermination, process\\_tracing},\n    pages = {702--721},\n    posted-at = {2010-10-21 11:17:32},\n    priority = {0},\n    publisher = {Oxford University Press},\n    title = {Process Tracing.
