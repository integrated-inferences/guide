**Map**

This (draft) guide is supplementary material for our book-in-progress *Integrated Inferences*.

* The [first part](#cm)  of the guide provides a brief motivation of causal models.
* The [second part](#package) describes how the package works and how to use it. 
* The [third part](#applications)  illustrates applications of the package for defining and learning from a set of canonical causal models. 
* The short [last part](#notation) has a notation guide.


**Credits**

The approach used in gbiqq is a generalization of the biqq models described in "Mixing Methods: A Bayesian Approach" [@humphreys2015mixing]. The conceptual extension makes use of work on probabilistic causal models described in Pearl's *Causality* [@pearl2009causality]. The approach to generating a generic stan function that can take data from arbitrary models was developed in key contributions by [Jasper Cooper](http://jasper-cooper.com/) and [Georgiy Syunyaev](http://gsyunyaev.com/). [Lily Medina](https://lilymedina.github.io/) did magical work pulling it all together and developing approaches to characterizing confounding and defining estimands. Clara Bicalho helped figure out a nice syntax for causal statements. Julio Solis made key contributions figuring out how to simplify the specification of priors.
