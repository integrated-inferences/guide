# A decision model

Parent of type $j\in \{G, N\}$ in ESB $i$ decides whether to send their child to school $k$

We assume they receive utility from attending school $k$ of:

  $$u^j_k = \delta_k^{\beta_1^j}q_k^{\beta_2^j} (\alpha^j_k)^{\beta_3^j}n_k^{\beta_4^j} - 1(k\neq i)c$$

where:

* $\delta$ is proximity to the school
* $q$ is school quality
* $\alpha$ is share of types that are similar to oneself
* $n$ is school size
* $c$ is a cost incurred for not attending your ESB school

The $\beta$ parameters are our estimands of interest

Using a quantile response approach we assume that the probability $j$ chooses school $k$ is then

$$\frac{exp(\lambda_j u^j_k)}{\sum_s exp(\lambda_j u^j_s) }$$

Where $\lambda^j$ is an overall rationality parameter.

This can be interpreted as optimal choice given ideosyncratic utility shocks to different schools.

* From this  we can derive a likelihood for the number of students in school $j$ in period $t$ given data from $t-1$.

We also assume that school quality depends on the number of students and, perhaps, class homogeneity, and, perhaps, previous year's quality. 

How might this system evolve? 


## Next step:

Simulate, assuming a negative weight on $n$ and positive weights on all other factors.
