# 9 Process Tracing from a Causal Model

## Theories in process tracing

* Process-tracers look to theory to justify probative value of observations

      * Did economic crisis cause collapse of this dictatorship?
      
      * Theory tells me economic crisis causes authoritarian collapse *by diminishing rents to regime supporters*, so...
      
      * I go and look for a clue: *Did rents to regime supporters diminish?*
      
* What sort of theory is this?

* How does it relate to models?

* How can we build process tracing atop a causal model?

<!-- * Our answer: yes. Process tracing is hostage to theory. -->

<!--       * So *the conclusions are credible to the extent that the theory is credible* -->

<!--       * This gets us into difficult waters, if you are wont to believe that theories are never credible) -->


<!-- ## Process tracing with mediator clue -->


<!-- ## Levels of theories -->

<!-- * We illustrated the types of higher level models that are *implied* by our running example --- there are many -->
<!-- * We also give examples of lower level models that imply the running example -->
<!--      * For instance an **extensive form game**, coupled with a **solution concept**, implies the dag in the running example. -->
<!--      * An even deeper model of play in abstract games, coupled with the claim that the game in question is being played implies the lower level model -->
<!--      * Multiple lower level models can of course imply a given higher level model -->

## Where does probative value come from?

* In Humphreys & Jacobs (2015), we denote probative value with $\phi$ parameters
    * $\phi_b$ = probability of seeing clue if case is a $b$ ($\theta_{01}$) type
    * $\phi_d$ = probability of seeing clue if case is a $d$ ($\theta_{11}$) type
    * Probative value for $X=Y=1$ case depends on difference between them




## Test types in continuous space


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="220px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testtypes.png")
```

## Where does probative value come from?

* But where do these probabilities come from? 

* The causal model

* Let's see how we can do this with somewhat generic lower-level models of 
    * mediation 
    * moderation 


## How to do process tracing with a causal model

## How to do process tracing with a causal model
    
1. Write down the causal query in a simple ("high level") model

2. Write down a *more detailed* ("lower-level") model expressing more specific beliefs

3. Redefine query in terms of nodes in lower-level model

4. Express prior beliefs over types in the lower-level model

5. Observe a node from the lower-level model that is NOT conditionally independent of query node(s)

6. Given this observation, eliminate (or reduce weight on) "types" incompatible with this evidence

7. Draw an inference, taking data and prior beliefs into account


## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

1. Express query in a simple model

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center", out.width='.8\\textwidth'}

hj_dag(x = c(1,2,2),
       y = c(1,1,2),
       names = c(
         "Free press (X)",
         "Govt removal (Y)",
         expression(paste(theta^Y))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(1,3),
                     c(2,2)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .28,
       padding = .2
)


```

Query: What is the value of $\theta_Y$? $\theta_{10}, \theta_{01}, \theta_{00}$, or $\theta_{11}$?

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

2. Write down lower-level model -- here, a mediation model

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center", out.width='.9\\textwidth'}


hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1  , 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),
         expression(paste(Y)),
         expression(paste(theta[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(R)),
         expression(paste(theta^R))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,5, 3, 5, 3)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .16,
       padding = .1
)

```

* Say we observe $X=1, Y=1$ in a case
* Did $X=1$ cause $Y=1$ in this case?
* How can we learn about this from $R$?

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

3. Define query on lower-level model

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center", out.width='.8\\textwidth'}


hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1  , 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),
         expression(paste(Y)),
         expression(paste(theta[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(R)),
         expression(paste(theta[R]))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,5, 3, 5, 3)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .16,
       padding = .1
)

```

* $X=1$ causes $Y=1$ if either:
    * $\theta^R = \theta_{01}$ and $\theta_Y^{lower} = \theta_{01}$: linked positive effects; or
    * $\theta^R = \theta_{10}$ and $\theta_Y^{lower} = \theta_{10}$: linked negative effects


## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

* A type-reduction table
* Columns are mediator response to $X$
* Rows are $Y$'s response to mediator
* Cells are higher-level types
    
|                 | $\theta_R=\theta_{10}$ | $\theta_R=\theta_{01}$ | $\theta_R=\theta_{00}$ | $\theta_R=\theta_{11}$ |
|-----------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| $\theta_Y^{lower}=\theta_{10}$ |         |         |         |         |
| $\theta_Y^{lower}=\theta_{01}$ |         |         |         |         |
| $\theta_Y^{lower}=\theta_{00}$ |         |         |         |         |
| $\theta_Y^{lower}=\theta_{11}$ |         |         |         |         |

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

(Skip 4, setting priors, for now.)

5. Observe a node NOT conditionally independent of query nodes

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center", out.width='.7\\textwidth'}


hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1  , 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),
         expression(paste(Y)),
         expression(paste(theta[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(R)),
         expression(paste(theta[R]))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,5, 3, 5, 3)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .16,
       padding = .1
)

```

* Assuming we have already observed $Y$, $R$ is NOT conditionally independent of:

    * $\theta_R$
    * $\theta_Y$
    
* $\Rightarrow R$ has possible probative value for our query


## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

6. Collect within-case data, eliminate incompatible "types"


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center", out.width='.5\\textwidth'}


hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1  , 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),
         expression(paste(Y)),
         expression(paste(theta[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(R)),
         expression(paste(theta[R]))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,5, 3, 5, 3)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .16,
       padding = .1
)

```


* Observing $R$ rules out some *lower-level* types for $\theta_R$ and $\theta_Y$

* Suppose we see $R=1$ (with $X=Y=1$). We can then deduce from the model:

    * $\theta_R \neq \theta_{10}$ (not a negative $X \rightarrow R$ effect)
    
    * $\theta_R \neq \theta_{00}$ ($R$ not stuck at 0)
    
    * $\theta_Y \neq \theta_{00}$ ($Y$ not stuck at 0---already knew that from seeing $Y=1$)
    
    * $\theta_Y \neq \theta_{10}$ (not a negative $R \rightarrow Y$ effect)
    
## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

* $\theta_R \neq \theta_{10}$ (not a negative $X \rightarrow R$ effect)
    
* $\theta_R \neq \theta_{00}$ ($R$ not stuck at 0)
    
* $\theta_Y \neq \theta_{00}$ ($Y$ not stuck at 0---already knew that from seeing $Y=1$)
    
* $\theta_Y \neq \theta_{10}$ (not a negative $R \rightarrow Y$ effect)

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4, fig.align="center", out.width='.5\\textwidth'}


hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1  , 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),
         expression(paste(Y)),
         expression(paste(theta[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(R)),
         expression(paste(theta[R]))
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,5, 3, 5, 3)),
       add_functions = 0,
       contraction = .16,
       padding = .1
)

```

* We've ruled out linked negative effects, and one kind of null effect

* But this does NOT answer our query. $R=1$ still consistent with:

    * $\theta_R = \theta_{01}$ (positive $X \rightarrow R$ effect)
    
    * $\theta_R = \theta_{11}$ (no $X \rightarrow R$ effect)
    
    * $\theta_Y = \theta_{01}$ (positive $R \rightarrow Y$ effect)
    
    * $\theta_Y = \theta_{11}$ (no $R \rightarrow Y$ effect)

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

* We need to bring *more* background knowledge to bear $\Rightarrow$ importance of priors

4. Express prior beliefs about possible causal effects in the model

* We likely know *something* about the relative plausibility of different possible causal effects in our model, e.g.:

    * How likely is it that a free press *reduces* reports of corruption? (Probably not very)
    
    * How likely is it that reports of corruption *keep* a government in office that would have otherwise been removed? (Also probably not very)
    
    
## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

4. Express prior beliefs about possible causal effects in the model, for example:

* **$\theta_R$: $X$'s effect on $R$**

    * $\theta_{10}$: A free press reduces reports of corruption: **Very unlikely ($0.1$)**

    * $\theta_{01}$: A free press increases reports of corruption: **Somewhat likely ($0.4$)**
       
    * $\theta_{00}$: Reports of corruption will be low regardless of whether the press is free: **Somewhat likely ($0.4$)**

    * $\theta_{11}$: Reports of corruption will be high regardless of whether the press is free: **Very unlikely ($0.1$)**




## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

4. Express prior beliefs about possible causal effects in the model

* Similar exercise for effects of media reports on government removal

* **$\theta_Y$: $R$'s effect on $Y$**

    * $\theta_{10}$: Reports of corruption prevent government removal: **Rather unlikely** ($0.2$)

    * $\theta_{01}$: Reports of corruption cause government removal: **More likely than not ($0.6$)**

    * $\theta_{00}$: Government removal will not happen regardless of reports of corruption. **Excluded** by $Y=1$ ($0$).

    * $\theta_{11}$: Government removal happens regardless of reports of corruption: **Rather unlikely** ($0.2$)**

* What is our posterior now on free press causes removal?

## Process tracing with a causal model: notional example

7. Draw inferences incorporating priors *and* the data

* Our priors over lower-level causal effects, imply a prior on higher-level effect of $X$ on $Y$:

    * Prior belief that free press caused govt removal = **$0.433$**

* If we observe many reports of corruption ($R=1$), posterior belief that free press caused removal moves up to **$0.6$**

* If we observe few reports of corruption ($R=0$), posterior belief that free press caused removal plummets to **$0.1$**

* $R$ is a fairly strict "hoop test" (Van Evera 1997) for the causal effect


## Process tracing with a causal model: how data and priors interact

* Prior knowledge has allowed us to put more weight on some intermediate causal possibilities than others

* E.g., observing $R=0$ forces us to eliminate the causal sequence that we considered the *more* likely way of generating a positive causal effect:

    * Linked positive effects of $X$ on $R$ and of $R$ on $Y$

* Only sequence consistent with the $X=1, R=0, Y=1$ that could generate a positive effect is one that prior knowledge already told us was very unlikely:

    * Free press reduces corruption reports; fewer corruption reports causes government removal

* Meanwhile, the no-effect types that we have eliminated were among least likely to begin with.

* End up with a belief set heavily tilted toward no effect



## Where does probative value come from?

In a mediation model:

\begin{eqnarray*}
\phi_{b1} &=& \frac{\lambda_{01}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y}}{\lambda_{01}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y}+\lambda_{10}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y}}\\ 
\phi_{d1} &=& \frac{\lambda_{11}^{Y}(\lambda_{01}^{K}+\lambda_{11}^{K})+\lambda_{11}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y}}{\lambda_{11}^{Y} + \lambda_{00}^{K}\lambda_{10}^{Y} + \lambda_{11}^{K}\lambda_{01}^{Y}}
\end{eqnarray*}


So $\phi_{b1}$ is the probabilty that $X$ causes $K$ and $K$ causes $Y$ divided by the probability (a positive channel) divided by the probability of a positive **or** a negative channel

## For us:

Can you think of any processes that involve a mediating variable for which you have a  theory given grounds to put constraints on possible values of lower level types?


## Process tracing with moderator clue: lower-level model of moderation


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, fig.align="center", out.width='.8\\textwidth'}

hj_dag(x = c(1,1,2,2, 1.5, 1.5),
       y = c(1,2,1,2, 1.5, 2),
       names = c(
         expression(paste(X)),
         expression(paste(U[X])),  
         expression(paste("Y")),  
         expression(paste(U[Y]^{lower})),
         expression(paste(K)),
         expression(paste(U[K])) 
         ),
       arcs = cbind( c(2,1, 4, 6, 5),
                     c(1,3, 3, 5, 3)),
             add_functions = 0, 
       contraction = .16, 
       padding = .2
)


```

* Suppose we observe $X=Y=1$.

* How can searching for $K$ help us determine whether $X=1$ caused $Y=1$?

## Process tracing with moderator clue: $U_Y^{lower}$'s range

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="200px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderation.png")
```


## Process tracing with moderator clue: $X,Y$ information

Observing $X=Y=1$ rules out all types in which $Y=0$ whenever $X=1$

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="200px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderationx1y1.png")
```


## Process tracing with moderator clue: learning from $K$

How does observing $K$ help us?

It helps us figure out:

* Which row we're in: How does the case respond to conditions?

* Which pair of columns to focus on

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="150px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderation.png")
```


## Process tracing with moderator clue: learning from $K$

So suppose we start with $X=Y=1$ and then observe $K=1$.

Did $X=1$ cause $Y=1$?

* Rows: Eliminate all where $Y=0 | X=K=1$ (3, 7, 11, 15)

* Columns: Must be second and fourth columns (As $K=1$)

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="150px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderation.png")
```


## Process tracing with moderator clue: learning from $K$

So suppose we start with $X=Y=1$ and then observe $K=1$.

Did $X=1$ cause $Y=1$?

* Rows: Eliminate all where $Y=0 | X=K=1$ (3, 7, 11, 15)

* Columns: Must be second and fourth columns

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="150px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderation2.png")
```


## Process tracing with moderator clue: learning from $K$

* This still doesn't answer the query: did $X=1$ cause $Y=1$?

    * It *did* if we're in rows 2, 4, 10, or 12
    
    * It *didn't* if we're in rows 6, 8, 14, or 16

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="150px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderation2.png")
```

So ultimately inference comes down to the weights on these rows.

## Probative value

We can also calculate $\phi_{b1}$ and $\phi_{d1}$ directly and use the approach from the higher level


$$\phi_{b1} = \frac{\pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{01}+\lambda_{10}^{01}+\lambda_{01}^{01}+\lambda_{11}^{01}\right)}{\pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{01}+\lambda_{10}^{01}+\lambda_{01}^{01}+\lambda_{11}^{01}\right)
+
(1-\pi^K)\left(\lambda_{01}^{00}+\lambda_{01}^{10}+\lambda_{01}^{01}+\lambda_{01}^{11}\right)}$$

i.e. $\Pr(K,b)/\Pr(b)$ (note in this simple example $X$ does not depend on type)

Similarly:

$$\phi_{d1} = \frac{\pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{11}+\lambda_{10}^{11}+\lambda_{01}^{11}+\lambda_{11}^{11}\right)}{\pi^K\left(\lambda_{00}^{11}+\lambda_{10}^{11}+\lambda_{01}^{11}+\lambda_{11}^{11}\right)
+
(1-\pi^K)\left(\lambda_{11}^{00}+\lambda_{11}^{10}+\lambda_{11}^{01}+\lambda_{11}^{11}\right)}$$


<!-- ## Process tracing with moderator clue: priors -->

<!-- We can form priors based on beliefs such as: -->

<!-- * free press will represent a threat to governments that are insensitive to public opinion -->

<!-- * free press could plausibly reinforce the legitimacy and thus prevent the removal of a government sensitive to public opinion (i.e., could have the opposite effect for a sensitive and an insensitive government) -->

<!-- * free press rarely prevents government removal when the government is insensitive to public opinion -->

<!-- * that sensitivity of the government to public opinion rarely causes government removal -->

<!-- * it is not unlikely that the free press has no effect, regardless of sensitivity -->

<!-- * it is somewhat likely that *neither* a free press nor sensitivity has an effect, regardless of the other.  -->


<!-- ## Process tracing with moderator clue: priors -->

<!-- These beliefs might yield priors like those in final column: -->

<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="200px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderationpriors.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Process tracing with moderator clue: priors plus $K$ -->

<!-- And then see how the elimination works: -->

<!-- ```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="120px", fig.align="center", eval = TRUE} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("figures/causaltypesmoderationpriors2.png") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- $K=1$ eliminates higher-probability rows with positive effects, e.g.: -->

<!-- * Eliminates rows 3 and 7, where positive effect if $K=0$ (which you think it could be before you've looked!) -->

<!-- * Retains rows 10 and 12, where positive effect if $K=1$, but very low priors -->

<!--     * Using background knowledge telling us that these effects are very unlikely -->


<!-- ## Process tracing with moderator clue: inference -->

<!-- * Our priors at lower-level, imply a prior on higher-level beliefs about positive causal effect: -->

<!--     * Calculate share of lower-level types that involve positive effects for a given value of $K$, weighted by prior probability $K$ takes on that value -->

<!--         * Means we also need a prior on $K=1$, which we set to 0.5 -->

<!--     * Prior: $p(U_Y^{higher}=t_{01}^{higher}|X=Y=1)=0.61$ -->

<!-- * If we observe $K=1$ (sensitive government), take remaining lower-level types consistent with positive causal effect when $K=1$, as a share of all remaining lower-level types -->

<!-- $\Rightarrow$ posterior: $p(U_Y^{higher}=t_{01}^{higher}|K=1, X=Y=1)=0.325$ -->

<!-- * If we observe $K=0$ -->

<!-- $\Rightarrow$ posterior: $p(U_Y^{higher}=t_{01}^{higher}|K=0, X=Y=1)=0.73$ -->



<!-- ## For us: -->

<!-- Can you think of any processes that involve a moderating variable for which you have a theory given grounds to put constraints on possible values of lower level types? -->
