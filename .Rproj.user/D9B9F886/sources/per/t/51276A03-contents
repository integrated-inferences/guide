* Represent Boix's argument as a DAG

    * Follow rules for drawing a DAG
    
* Can you capture everything?

    * What are acceptable simplifications?

## Comparing DAGs     
    
* What are key differences between Boix and A/R graphs?

* Are there differences in functional equations? Or in beliefs about types implied by the two?
